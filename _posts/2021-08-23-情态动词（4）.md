**情态动词（4）**

* had better
* would rather

1. had better 表示“最好做某事”，had 虽然是过去式，但不表征过去，better 后面接动词原形。

    1. He **had better** eat more.
    2. You **'d better** finish it right now.

2. would rather 表示“宁愿、宁可、最好、还是……为好”，语感上比“had better”要轻。

    1. You **would rather** deal with it now.

3. 否定形式分别为：

    had better not + 动词原形

    would rather not + 动词原形

    1. He **had better not** eat more.
    2. You **would rather not** deal with it now.

练习：

1. You <u>had better</u> stay here.  
    你最好待在这儿。

2. I <u>would rather</u> not say it.  
    我还是不说的好。
